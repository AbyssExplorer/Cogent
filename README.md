# Cogent
A simple CLI for generating client credentials tokens for AWS Cognito App Clients

## Usage
1. Download executable from releases, copy it into a folder.
2. Add the folder path in environment variable for easy access.
3. Run `cogent` (uses `us-east-1` as default region) or `cogent --region {{region}}`


> You need to configure aws credentials (profile: default) so cogent can read and use them
